                        <p>The Los Angeles Rams suffered a heartbreaking 26-23 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Wednesday night at SoFi Stadium, dropping their record to 3-2 on the season. Despite a valiant effort from quarterback Matthew Stafford and the offense, the Rams couldn't quite overcome their division rivals in what many are calling one of the best games of the young season.</p>
                        
                        <p>Stafford threw for 287 yards and 2 touchdowns in the loss, connecting frequently with star receiver Puka Nacua, who hauled in 8 catches for 97 yards. The Rams offense moved the ball effectively throughout the game but struggled in the red zone, settling for field goals on two crucial drives in the fourth quarter.</p>
                        
                        <p>"We had our opportunities," said head coach Sean McVay after the game. "Credit to San Francisco, they made the plays when they needed to. We'll learn from this and bounce back stronger."</p>

                        <p>Second-year receiver Puka Nacua continues to rewrite the Rams record books, leading the team with 52 receptions for 588 yards through the first five games of the season. The former BYU standout has become Matthew Stafford's favorite target and a key component of the Rams' high-powered passing attack.</p>
                        
                        <p>Nacua's 11.3 yards per reception average demonstrates his versatility, making catches both over the middle and on the outside. His chemistry with Stafford has been evident since training camp, and the duo looks poised to be one of the NFL's most dynamic quarterback-receiver combinations for years to come.</p>

                        <p>All-Pro receiver Cooper Kupp has been listed as day-to-day with a minor hamstring strain that kept him out of Wednesday's game against San Francisco. The team remains optimistic that Kupp will return to action soon, though they are taking a cautious approach with their star receiver.</p>
                        
                        <p>"Cooper's health is our top priority," said head coach Sean McVay. "We won't rush him back until he's 100%. We have confidence in our other receivers to step up in his absence."</p>
                        
                        <p>In Kupp's absence, Davante Adams has stepped up with 22 catches for 357 yards, providing veteran leadership and reliable hands for the Rams' passing attack.</p>

                        <p>The Rams will look to bounce back from their loss to San Francisco when they travel to Green Bay to face the Packers next Sunday. The game will mark a return to Lambeau Field for several Rams players and coaches, including quarterback Matthew Stafford, who spent time in the NFC North during his Detroit Lions days.</p>
                        
                        <p>Green Bay enters the matchup with a 2-3 record but has shown flashes of their potential, particularly on offense with quarterback Jordan Love leading the way. The Rams will need to contain the Packers' passing attack while establishing their own ground game with Kyren Williams, who has rushed for 368 yards this season.</p>
                        
                        <p>Kickoff is set for 1:00 PM ET at Lambeau Field, with the game being televised nationally on Fox.</p>
